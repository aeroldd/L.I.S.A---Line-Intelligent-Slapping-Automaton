Aerold Parcon and Anas Gomaa's brain child (Heriot Watt University - 1st Year Robotics Group Project B37VR Final Project)

Meet L.I.S.A - an intelligent robot controlled by an Arduino Uno that:
- Follows lines with a high degree of accuracy and precision
- Avoids obstacles by slapping them out of her way
- Has audio and visual cues to show what its doing
- Has lots of attitude

This repository houses all the source code, and other Arduino sketches used in the design and implementation of L.I.S.A.
