L.I.S.A - Your Line Intelligent Slapping Automaton

Aerold Parcon and Anas Gomaa's brain child (Heriot Watt University - 1st Year Robotics Group Project B37VR Final Project)

Meet L.I.S.A - an intelligent robot controlled by an Arduino Uno that:
- Follows lines with a high degree of accuracy and precision
- Avoids obstacles by slapping them out of her way
- Has audio and visual cues to show what its doing
- Has lots of attitude

This repository houses all:
- All of L.I.S.A's brains (Arduino sketches used to control L.I.S.A's systems)
- Testing code and all the individual systems used in designing the final source code
- Sketches, CAD files and diagrams of the body and chasis
- Schematics of all sorts (Circuits, systems, etc)
- Your personal - How to make your own L.I.S.A instruction handbook.
- L.I.S.A care guide
