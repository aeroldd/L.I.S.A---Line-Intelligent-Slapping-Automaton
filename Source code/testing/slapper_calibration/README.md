SLAPPER CALIBRATION
This sketch is used to calibrate the minimum and maximum angle for slapping in L.I.S.A's obstacle avoidance system.
The right minimum and maximum angles must be determined so that the internal support structures in the chasis wouldnt get slapped on the way.

This sketch uses a potentiometer to set the angle and a button to confirm the angle
Once the program is finished running, the program prints out the minimum and maximum angles of the slap.
These values will be used in the slapper arm in the final L.I.S.A source code.
